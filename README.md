# NYPR Quotable

Inspired by [NPR Quotable][1] (though the two projects share no code).

The tool is intended to allow users to quickly make JPEG quotes that can be shared on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social networks where images are more "shareable" than just straight text.

### Installation

The project built entirely using front-end tools. To self-host this project, simply clone the git repository (or, in Github, click on "Download ZIP" on the right side).

Once cloned/downloaded, you may upload anywhere that can serve HTTP.

### Usage

The project is designed for NYPR, but can be used by other companies / brands. The git repository contains a branch, `wvpb-master`, that is modified for use by West Virginia Public Broadcasting.

Run `git diff master..wvpb-master` to see what files and code needs to be changed in order to modify the branding of the app.
